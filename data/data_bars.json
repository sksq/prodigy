This place is really cool and gives off a complete adult pub vibe. Loud music, huge screens complete with a DJ. Not suitable for family, especially on weekends. The crowd is crazy as it gets late! Table Reservation is highly recommended. The drinks were amazing at this place and the price was also decent. The food was decent as well nothing more. Overall experience was satisfactory but nothing out of the ordinary.\nTip: If you are looking for a place to drink and chill either alone or with a partner, please step right in. If you are with friends to engage in some conversations and gossip - well it might not be your cup of tea!\n\nFood: 7/10\nDrinks: 8/10\nService: 9/10\nAmbience: 7/10"}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-07-13 21:07:38", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["10", "1"], "text": "Finally I went to Gilly's after reading a lot of nice reviews about it. We went on a sunday evening and the place was jam packed! The ambience is nice but the music is played too loud. We had a pitcher beer, jim bean, 100 pipers and tequila shots.\nFood is amazing, Mother-in-law eggs was unlike anything I've ever had before. The entire menu is perfect accompaniment for drinks. \nGreat ambience and music. The pork ribs, the bacon wrapped prawns are my personal favourites . Also, try out the gillys specials . Truly a gem.

But once my friends forced and i joined with them to Gilly's. Since i don't drink anything except beer, i concentrated on food menus and to my wonder and delight this place serves wonderful, tasteful and very sought after taste dishes. I specially love their Peshawari chicken tandoor and fried corns. I bet i never found this taste anywhere else. Now i visit this place quietly with my wife, take a corner place and enjoy their awesome food. Please tell this to your kitchen staff who prepare this dish and if possible please tell us the recipe of Peshawari tandoori chicken. \ud83d\ude01"}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-07-12 16:42:49", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["8", "2"], "text": "This is one of the best places I've been to on my birthday!

But was pretty much disappointed with the attitude of the manager inside the AC room . \nI was seated and was about to order and waiting for a friend to join - male friend ( point to be noted)\nThis manager comes and asks if I am waiting for a male friend or, a female friend . I communicated which gender I was waiting for and in reply the manager asks me to move because the table was apparently gender sensitively reserved . He shows me one corner of the room - as if I am the untouchable one and alternatively he asks me sit outside in the smoking area - which I won't because I don't . \nGillies - you seriously need to handle your customer in a much more professional way . I understand your concern about weekends and no stag policy . But I don't think once you let a customer in , they need to follow your orders and sit according to your comfort .

The menu is very well done - they have a wide assortment to pick from(both drinks and food) and what strikes you is the the menu itself - it is very well done(categorized beautifully). We ordered for beer, mojitos and a few martinis - they were wonderful. We also ordered \"Herb grilled fish\" and a \"Gilley's Galley Mix\" to go with the drinks - the food was not extraordinary but good. The ambiance is great with the walls showered with sarcastic wisdom quotes(which is great for conversation) but the music is VERY LOUD. The seating arrangement looks cramped - it's like multiple tables are glued together. The cocktail waiters are extremely helpful and professional but for no reason at all there's this clown/jester/a mascot?(I don't know) who walks around the place shaking hands with you and trying to make you feel comfortable - I thought this was a little annoying, my friend told me she thought he was creepy so I'm guessing it's not just me. If you want to have a great time with friends and not wait for a table I recommend this place!"}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-05-07 22:55:35", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["8", "1"], "text": "Superb place to hangout with friends..it has super energetic music and pocket friendly dishes to try...must try silicon valley mocktail and mother in law eggs"}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-05-07 14:19:53", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["25", "25"], "text": "An ausum place to visit. u can find gud crowd even on weekdays.

And finally the rendezvous happened on a drizzly Wednesday evening.\n\nConvenient location with valet parking is priceless in the JNC area in Koramangala. They have Bollywood Karaoke on Wednesdays which was a mood spoiler for me; I absolutely love Bollywood numbers but only when records are played. Not going there on Wednesdays for sure.\n\nThe ambiance and decor are nice with a sober crowd and perfect lighting for a bar. Unlimited cocktails + shooters for the ladies is an add-on. Service is very attentive and efficient. Food was very good and each item had a distinct taste. We ordered for some chilli wings, french fries, chicken platter along with a pitcher of draught beer. The chilli wings were the right kind of spicy while the french fries were yummy crispy. The platter is sufficient for 3 to enjoy the taste - however, if you want to really savor the taste, then one platter serves 2. The platter has a good mix of several chicken starters with each having its own flavor.\n\nFor the kind of place this is and the food it serves, the prices are reasonable. Our bill was around 1800 (incl. taxes and service charges). Overall, it was a good experience and one can visit with friends as well as with the special someone."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-07-13 23:55:37", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["14", "30"], "text": "Wednesday night - Bollywood Karaoke Night.

Valet parking was not available even though it was a weekday evening. We had ordered Beer and boozy chicken wings and griffin chicken platter. There was offer of cocktail on the house for ladies. We loved the sweet and sour chicken wings. The platter was also interesting as it had small portion of various chicken starters which already reflect in the menu.\u00a0\nThere was a Karaoke night as well, which can be a little annoying at times, but adds to the cheerful mood.

There is a neat bar-type seating arrangement right in the middle of the Pub where we seated ourselves. We had taken booking with EazyDiner but they bailed out leaving us absolutely helpless, but we managed to get a place after a 30-mins wait. [Note: Reservation is a must if you go there and don't book through a third party company]The good part:The music is decent, though they mix up pop, rock and metal [very few], so if you are a Legends of Rock level music lover, you will find this place a bit obnoxious. The food is good, we took a non-veg platter that included squid and octopus, quite tasty. A 'veg' friend of ours ordered the Bruschetta which was good too. The drinks were served on time and were up to the mark too.Overall, if you like crowded places, with loads of people doing bizarre Bhangra dance to 'Losing my Religion', then this is your place, you are sure to have fun here!"}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-06-30 22:03:39", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "12", "review_and_follow": ["367", "2095"], "text": "From the name only you are getting an Idea it's all about booze no my dear friend food is also great here.

I wish to write it little lengthy so please don't mind.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Starting from the drink we got all of the drinks vodka based because it's one of the finest spirit well known for it's flavor absorption from other ingredients.\n1. Live and Let Die - Drink in the light purple shade... Really wow I don't have any other word.\n2. Golden Finger - Someone should change the name with the Kahlua it's awesome for coffee lovers. Noncoffee addicts please don't order.\n3. Thunder Ball - With Pomegranate Nectar the drink is in heaven. As the taste little (very little) on the sweeter side but the mixologist (Sorry I forgotten the Name) is well knowledged and experienced to grab my attention.\n4. Harvey WallBanger - One of the finest and traditional drink you may find in any English Bar.\n5. Sangria - They have 2 awesome variety of those White and Dark/Red. I liked a lot their listing skills.\n6. Frozen Margarita - I like Margarita though not a great fan of Frozen one.\n7. Dot Com - Good try.\n\u00a0\nOnly Mocktail How I can Forget\nKey Lime Pie tim - Gorgeous one white in color and you can feel creamy texture while having it. Really good one Must Order.\nFood ahh Chef Javed obviously good with his skills... I have to say that\nIn Meat and poultry\n1. Boozy Chilli Wings - Really yummy in taste and good in texture.\n2.

The seating, the bar counter, the small telephone booth by the side add to the feel. \n\nThe variety of food, even for vegetarians is more than I expected. I had been told a lot about the magic shrooms being their specialty and had high expectations, and I must confess, it lived beyond my expectations. It not only looks great on the plate, but tastes great as well. It is served with a mango based dip, which was my favourite. \nThey served prawns in a cocktail glass, and it tasted so good, i crave for another piece. Crispy and perfectly cooked. \nThe chicken parmesana and the fish fingers dipped in tequila, are new additions to their menu. Despite not being a very big fan of fish, I fell in love with the fish fingers. The chicken parmesana is cheesy and tender. Perfectly seasoned. \nMy favourite part of the night happened to be the shooters they had. \nThe Bob Marley shooter with 3 layers looked absolutely tempting. A banana and vodka based drink with grenadine. It tastes as good as it looks. \nHot Tequila, with hot Cheetos and tequila was a drink that'll spice up your throat. It's spicy and hot as the name suggests. \nMy favourite of the 3 was the Mince Mangoneda. They made their sauce and added a pinch of salt, pepper and chat masala to this tequila based shooter. And once you drink this, you're sure to fall in love with it. \nCocktails here have a big variety too. \n\"Dot Com\" a pineapple flavoured vodka based cocktail gives off so much freshness and a slight tinge in the end. \n\"Live and let live\" a dark blue drink with vodka and triple sec was a delight. \nThe red wine and white wine sangrias are so yumm. And have the perfect blend. \nCoffee lovers will love the \"Kahlua\" espresso drink. It's coffee and alcohol, what's not to love about? \n\nThis place has the best staff. The bartenders were super friendly and the chef himself was so accommodative. \nIt has the best shows happening in town. The Bollywood karaoke night is a full house every Wednesday. \nVisit with your friends to have the best time."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-06-30 12:05:00", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["28", "86"], "text": "So, Bangalore, English pub and beer. I thought it was going to be like all the other places. But, man was I surprised. The place sure leaves a long lasting memory of its Saturday Nights. Somehow, I meet the most chilled out people I've seen at pubs at this place. Well, booze is the same everywhere, so can't post a review on that. But the food here is great.

Their style is unique and they live up to their claim of being a British pub.\n\nFood-\nI tried a variety of their vegetarian starters and each had a unique taste to it.\nTheir magic shrooms are to die for!! A well crafted and engineered dish, with mushrooms well placed and neat over their patty filling. Both blend well to get your taste buds wanting for more.\nTheir spinach and corn vou levent was a well garnish dish with crispy corn which tasted the same as I had in black pearl above and is fantastic! This dish was a little dry so I ordered a serving of mango jalepeno to go with this and to much luck it was fantastic!\nPlus points for having given an option of the choice of sauce we like.\nThe santa-fe spring rolls were served in a cocktail glassware which was a unique style and was very impressive. The flavours were good but they needed to be cooked more and made more crisp.\nThe cheesy onion rings are amazing! A little more of liquid cheese to be added! Yummy stuff!\n\nCocktails-\nI had an opurtunity to taste their specials and upcoming drinks.\n\nHarvey wallbanger, this a cutely garnished drink with vodka and triple sec. The taste was good and triple sec used was overpowering!\nForgot this drinks name , I loved the blue-black colour of this drink! Again a vodka based drink andt this tasted yum! Wondered if a little twist of orange would taste good.\nFig cocktail, this drink has fig pulp with vodka , tripple sec and this tasted the best so far! I love how the flavour of fig was so well combined with alcohol.\nPomogranade based drink, garnished well with pomogranade and another vodka based drink! Definetly a try if you love the pomogranade with citrus taste!\nLive and let live, This drink comes with kahula , coffee extract and topped with chocolate flakes for garnish a very pretty drink tasted like khalua and raw coffee. A coffee lover might just love this!\nDot com, this was the freshest alcoholic drink ive ever had! This fizzy drink has fresh pineapple juice and vodka with lime! I'm definetly going back for this again!\n\nShooters -\nThe mince mangoneda was the best of all, probably cause of the kind of effort that goes in to have making , they make their own sauce which is lined on the glassware and silverware. This shot was amazing!\nHot tequila, this was tequlia moved with hot cheetos and a lot of tequila! Added on with the tobasco sauce , yum stuff!\nBob Marley, a wonderful drink i'd only seen in the internet, good to have tased this.

I went there with my partner on a Wednesday and we were one of the first ones to arrive. We sat by the bar and ordered some beef chilly, which was done exceptionally well. One of the best I've had till date. We also ordered the lamb, which was done in a southern style, since it was fried, I didn't really enjoy it that much but still the meat was exceptionally tender and well cooked, another stalwart was the pepperoni pizza, done so well that it was unbelievable. I would defiantly like to talk about the service which was really good. I must congratulate the managers and hats off to the chef. \n\nDefinitely coming back."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-06-19 13:28:38", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["9", "1"], "text": "I visited this place on a Sat during the happy hours.

There is an essence of English pubs. As soon as you enter you can see the waiters all dressed up like the medieval English men with the hat on. The environment is very friendly at boozy :D\nThe FOOD- this is a paradise for both vegetarians and non vegetarians :D\nAs there is a balance between the number of dishes in each category. They have a wide variety of food spread in their menu. I would suggest you to eat magic shrooms (highly recommended) , chicken wings, chicken parmesan, crispy onion rings, basket corn(again very yummy), tequila fish fingers.\nCOCKTAILS AND SHOOTERS- you can get the most refreshing cocktails at this place specially \"dot com\" it's a pineapple juice vodka based cocktail, it just freshens you up and makes you fly high. Hot Cheetos shooters is spicy and yummmm and even a banana flavored shooter i would recommend.\nSince I had been on the HUMP day of the week that's the Wednesday, there was karaoke night event going on. The K.J there is very friendly and also has a lot of songs ranging from all classic old songs to all the new dinchak songs.

The seats are very comfortable and there's a lot of space between tables. \n\nThe cocktails were simply amazing. My concern at other pubs had always been that the drinks are very diluted, but boy oh boy these people don't hold back. The long island ice tea and the East India CO were amazing, I recommend these two drinks.\n\nFood was fine. The cheese balls were a bit  spicy but the BBQ chicken rolls were really good.\n\nI highly recommend this place."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-05-21 10:25:19", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 3.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["4", "22"], "text": "Friday night\nThe live band was awesome\nIt has a good seperate smoking lounge\nBut the DJ sada on the friday night sucks\nThey need to change the DJ\nFood was good\nAnd prices are moderate too\nThe service was also good"}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-05-21 10:18:34", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 3.0", "likes": "1", "review_and_follow": ["5", "15"], "text": "\"DJ was not good\"\nThe Live band rocked last night but the DJ was not good ...

I absolutely love their English style pub interior and cozy couches. You might not get what I am saying if you go here on a Friday or Saturday night since it isn\u2019t that spacious inside BG. But, on a weekend afternoon( and weekdays if that is an option) you can hang out with your friends with enough space to move. A combination of good music and location elevates the standards of this place further.\n\nAnd that telephone booth mockup they have stationed outside the smoking zone. I feel it was an utterly brilliant idea and kudos to whoever came up with that. I feel it provides the place a character of its own.\n\nAnd the Food \u2013 absolutely lip-smacking.

I have never been to boozy griffin so I was looking\nforward to it. \n\nAmbiance : \n\nAs soon as I entered , I felt like I was in UK in a English pub,\nexcept the Loud , ear crashing music\u00a0 (\nwhats with the music in pubs) , If there is a discotheque\u00a0 then its understandable\u00a0 otherwise whats the point of playing such\nloud music. \n\n\u00a0The ambiance is great\n, the seating place is superb with the comfortable couches and high chairs ,\nAnd the bar looks great too. \n\nI haven\u2019t clicked any pictures\u00a0 as it was an office outing . But loved the\nmusic. \n\nAgain, There is really no need of the Loud music when there\nis no dance floor . \n\n\u00a0\n\nFood : \n\nOurs was a package \n\nWith unlimited drinks ( IMFL , beers ) and some set menu of\nstarters ,maincourse and desserts. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI ordered Mojito and it was yumm , \n\nVeg starters\u00a0 had\u00a0 paneer chilli , Mushroom chilli and fried\ncorn. It was all ok . \n\nNon veg starters included , chicken wings, Fish\u00a0 and one more thing which I don\u2019t remember\nnow. \n\nEverybody raved about the fish , So it must be good. \n\nMain course we had the Pizza, chicken\u00a0 biryani and pasta, A lot of people ordered\npizza and liked it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nService : \n\nThere were three waiters who were looking after us, and they\ndid not allow any glass to be empty or any plate without food. \n\nLoved it. \n\nKaraoke: \n\nThursday was the English songs karaoke nights and the guy ( I\nthink DJ) sang beautifully. I heard pink Floyd after such a long time , Made me\nnostalgic . \n\nThere is a girls night on Wednesday and there are Bollywood songs\nAND there are free shooters for ladies, Which sounds pretty good. \n\nVFM : \n\nOur corporate package was around 1400 with taxes which\nincluded the drinks and food. Actually pretty decent . \n\n\u00a0\n\nWould I go here again : \n\nWell , I liked the ambiance and it was ok with the Office\ngroup . \n\nBut the music is so loud that I wouldn\u2019t want to go here\nwith friends or husband where I need to talk to people."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-03-19 23:15:59", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 3.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["11", "94"], "text": "The place has one of the best interiors in Bangalore.

Music was alright and could have been better (should play more hard rock and metal). the volume was a little low as compared to other pubs.\n\nFood:  was alright and bit costly  \n\nNevertheless, we had a pleasant time and the place actually became more happening and noisy after 11 pm."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-02-27 13:07:00", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 3.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["240", "375"], "text": "Boozy Griffin is very English pub like ambiance with very low lighting and comfy sofas.

To be honest, I was completely surprised to see the rustic styled British Pub, dim lighting and comfortable seating! Sofa & Wood works everywhere, just awesome!\n\nIt took sometime for us to settle down as we were deciding what to order (the menu was styled like The Yellow Pages For Liquor).\n\nWe ordered Our Own Favourite Drinks on the Menu and Few went with Draught Beer & For The Starters we Ordered Assorted Bruschetta & Magic Shrooms For The Vegetarians and For The Non Vegetarians we Ordered Britpop Prawns,Boozy Chilli Wings,Chilli Beef Fry nad For the Heavy Builders in The Group The Nonveg Platter. The staff taking the order was extremely patient with all the mess-up that we were creating while ordering, and believe me everything we ordered were served right, the way we wanted without any flaw.\n\nFor The Mains we Just Ordered Penne Pomodoro,Spaghetti Bolognaise and the The Fresh Dough Pizza for which the Toppings were of the Chefs Choice Recommended by the Handsome Waiter.\n\nBeing the Drinks which is Normal whereever u order the Cocktails were Good particularly in this Place.The Place and The Live DJ makes u feel Sweeped off with a Royal Experience.\n\nWhat else can you expect a Great Hangaround with Friends!!!!!\nThey serve the food well Presented and the quantity is good enough to fill your stomach. I would rate it how much ever I can think of when it comes to factors such as the place, the ambiance, quick service and the food.\u00a0\n\nAs per my experiences on English Pub, this is by far the best. Elsewhere priced (almost) the same but you may not get the perfectness as of this place.\n\nWould definitely visit the place again to try other items on the menu.\n\nHappy Boozing & eating :)\n\nCheers!"}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-01-04 18:09:07", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "likes": "2", "review_and_follow": ["8", "41"], "text": "This place is nice and management is quite good.

Wrong service + lies + what the hell are you doing?\n3. We ordered a sandwich whioch was described as a grilled sandwich with a crumb fried patty, greens & onion rings. What arrived was a club sandwich with boiled eggs, mayo chicken & no onion rings on a wilted lettuce leaf.\n4. My vegan friend asked for quesadillas without cheese for which they said it was impossible to serve it without cheese! of course mild customization for your clients must be too much to ask for!!!\n5. prices & service & food quality are not an equal match. \u00a0You will pay for what the chef & staff decide to torture with you while you are there."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2016-01-01 00:41:09", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["71", "81"], "text": "My experience at the boozy griffin was great.\nGood food, good music..and good ambience.\nCocktails were ok..I had a martini which was fine..overall a great experience"}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2015-12-29 12:55:33", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["21", "70"], "text": "Excellent food, and good music.

The rating is purely based on my weekday afternoon experience here, so naturally it wasn't very happening. In fact not happening at all, apart from me n my friend there were two other guys meeting their start up's investor;) yes i did evasdrop on their convesation.....cause the place was dead.\nOtherwise the ambience is too good and so is the music and the food. Nachos was ultimate. Other dishes too are very delicious and so is the quantity and quality.\n\nM sure the place would definitely be awesome on a friday or saturday evening.\n\nWill edit this review once I get a chance to re-visit this place with some accurate timing."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2015-12-25 07:36:02", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "0", "review_and_follow": ["11", "2"], "text": "Visited this restaurant last week for lunch.

Since people had just started leaving, I ran down to check if anyone is leaving with my jacket, I couldn't see anyone so I quickly came on back and informed the manager or whoever staff was available. Luckily I had kept my wallet and other items in my jeans however I was sad coz my jacket was missing and it had my main key, friend from US had given it.. I felt helpless as the staff was not helpful at all.. When most of the people emptied the place, the staff and the so called bouncers showed their real behavior.. They were rude and it shocked me when they asked questions like, who asked you to be alone, etc.. @#%\u20b9 I had to tell them that I am not under 18 that I needed a guardian, I am 30+ and I was the person who had just paid the bill... They slowly started chasing me out and were behaving like low class rowdies..!! I have no plans of ending in that place again..

We also had Tex Amex Nachos and it was filled with cream, sauce and olives and also in good quantity. It was good. The service is very good. \n\nDefinitely recommended and worth a revisit. Cool for a quiet Sunday hangout with friends unlike other dance bars."}, {"source": "zomato", "timestamp": "2015-11-15 23:09:53", "comments": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "3", "review_and_follow": ["24", "75"], "text": "Great music and ambiance.

So overall ambience of music with food, beer and match won my heart.\n\nFood: 4/5\nWe ordered 1 beer tower along with 5 food items and one pan flavour hukka. Food was overall good quantity as well as quality wise.\nWe ordered:\n1. Corn n cheese: 2/5\nRealllyy cheesy. I understand as name suggests it is supposed to be cheesy, but it was bland. No taste other than simply cheese. \n2. Chicken satay: 4/5\n Star dish of the evening. Really tender, amazing blend of spices and tastes yummmm when hot.\n3. Chilli pork\nI didn't eat this, so can't say but my boyfriend loved it.\n4. French fries:4/5\nReally crisp, humungus amount which they serve, perfect on salt.\n5.

I'd expect people to go to this place just to hangout for some hrs with chilled drinks. We ordered the Bacon wrapped sausages,Nachos and the cheesy garlic fries to go along with our drinks. The fries and the bacon were wonderful. The Nacho's was a big let down. No taste whatsoever. The beans weren't soft and not much jalape\u00f1os. We didn't want some heavy dinner soo we just went onto to order the chicken burger and popcorn chicken.

Anyway after some convincing we got the table.\n\nService was pathetically slow. It was as if they completely forgot about us or chose to ignore us. Either we had to patiently wait or get up and draw their attention.\n\nThe food however was the saving grace. Liked the Rathnagiri Mutton and Coorg Pork Fry.

But the service is a little disappointing as we had to call out to the waiters constantly before they heard us and pester them some more till they served us. \nThe menu isn't extensive or very impressive, it's got regular finger food and a few out of place dishes. \nWhat's impressive is the quantity of beer they serve for a reasonable price.

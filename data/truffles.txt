It is running it's brand name since a decade, and obviously since, it's very much packed. Although, after you get through the crowd, the food is promising. After much waiting, soothe your guts with their 'Ferrero Rocher' shake. American cheese burger is a must try, although one must explore the menu. My suggestion is to go there in a big group, so that you get to order lot many different things and get a taste of all. The quantity that they serve is also quite a bit, and i wouldn't rate it as an overpriced place. \nPros: Food, food and food\nCons: Crowd, crowd and crowd\n\nHappy Munching :)", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "comments": "0", "review_and_follow": ["57", "135"], "likes": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2016-07-13 21:25:19", "source": "zomato", "text": "As usual mentained the truffles standards went n no of times n liked every tym dis outlet is a bit lacky in terms of service mayo used is a bit different in taste rest all cool...", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "comments": "0", "review_and_follow": ["3", "6"], "likes": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2016-07-13 19:31:42", "source": "zomato", "text": "After a long wait, finally went to try this restaurant.

They are known for their cheese burgers. So me and my friend decided to visit this place on a weekend. We had to wait for an hour to get a seat in. It was a really crowded place due to its popularity and of course, weekend. So, was it worth the wait? Yes, it definitely was! I ordered an All American Cheese burger (chicken), Cheesy Mex Fries and Ferrero Rocher Coffee. The burger was really unique and it was a must try for chicken and cheese lovers!\ud83d\ude0d the concept of a melting cheese patty coupled with the chicken burger was something which made it really gooey and tasty! The chips served on the side was also something different than the usual fries. The Cheesy Mex Fries wasn't that great. The sauces didn't mix well with the fries and so did the cheese. The Ferrero rocher coffee was another amazing beverage to try out. The chocolate along with ice cream and coffee made it taste like heaven\ud83d\ude0d the ambience and interior were really good too. overall the standout was their cheese burger which I would definitely recommend to everyone!", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "comments": "0", "review_and_follow": ["25", "19"], "likes": "2"}, {"timestamp": "2016-07-06 15:42:23", "source": "zomato", "text": "Have been here a lot of times.

But I actually can't say less about this one.So here it goes:\n\nI have been here at least 6 times, of which got a straight NO to my face the first time for showing up here by 930 pm on a Saturday night. It was so darn crowded that the lady said the restaurant is closed because too many people are waiting already. That made me want to visit this restaurant again, so went there the very next day.\n\nI had reached there by 1230 pm , thought nobody would show up since the restaurant opens only by 12. But guess what?, I got the table only by 1400. I was so pissed when I had gone in.\n\nBut here's the thing, once I was in I couldn't even remember the duration of time I had waited outside.\n\nFood which I have ordered till now is either very good or great.\n\nThings you should probably order:\nCheese burger\nButter paneer Burger (Yummy desi flavour)\nVery vanilla (it has just a bit of caramel taste but it's P-E-R-F-E-C-T)\nFerero rocher milk shake\nFiery baby corn\n\nI have heard there are lots of items on the menu which is not even up to the mark, but why bother about that when there is options for tasty one's.\n\nI don't eat chicken, yet based on what I heard you can try\n\nTex Mex burger\nPeri Peri Burger\nSloppy Joe\n\nI like the blueberry cheesecake here, there's not a good amount of cheese though, yet it tastes good.\n\nTheir wafers and the mayo, the combination is just too good. I personally am a huge fan of their Mayo.\n\nAbout their service, have to tell it's one of the best you can get in such a busy restaurant.\nNormally if there's too much crowd waiting, the waiter will take your order really quick and bring the items ASAP so that you leave and they can make more business from the same table. But these people have broken the rules.\n\nOnce you have placed your main course(let's say), these people will not even be nearing your table unless you call them.

Also we were sitting next to the window. Given the crowd outside, it gets uncomfortable and feels like someone breathing down your nose when you eat.\nOverall Ambience - 3/5\nFor a place which has large crowds waiting, one expects the waiters to be quick to hand menus and be on the watch to take the orders. It might be a comparitively relaxed day in terms of crowd since it was lunch time on a weekday, but the waiters had to be really called for us to give the order. They also had to be reminded multiple times to provide glasses and extra plates.\nOn the food service itself, it was really quick. So quick that the burgers and chicken with veg and rice came almost instantaneously, they were then followed by the beverages and nachos and finally after some time did we get knock knock(the starter). This does knock of some points from the otherwise quick service. Staff was courteous throughout.\nOverall I'll give them a 3.5/5 on this. \nComing to the food itself - the chicken with veggies and rice was pretty average.\nThe burgers, while impressively large in size, were good, but I have had better. Not something I'd make a big fuss about.\nThe nachos were very good, and that is something I would recommend. The chips appeared to be Doritos.\nKnock knock, mentioned as a starter, was in sufficient quantity as a main dish. I would highly recommend this perfection of veggies baked in a cheese and potato base, topped with really fresh and fragment sauces and seasonings. The serving along with a beautiful arrangement of garlic bread is something I would create hope about. This dish gets a 5/5,.\nThe deserts were again, though good, not great.\nThe cheesecake was at room temperature. The same would have tasted much better had it been colder. Chocolate mud pie and the brownie, were again above average, but below didn't go further.\nOverall for the food 4/5.\nThis place was highly recommended by lot of friends, colleagues and online. This resulted in my expectations to be very high.

This sums up Truffles. I visit Bangalore often, and am always on the lookout for a highly recommended establishment. This one came with almost unbelievably high ratings and I almost forced my partner to try it with me. We went in around 4pm on a weekday, a table was ready for us. We did not want to stick to burgers, and instead were looking to explore some of their other offerings. But when we asked the waiter for recommendations, he could only come up with burgers.\n\nMight as well, we thought, since that is what this place apparently is known as. We ordered the American cheese burger with chicken and the lamb burger. Also, what's a burger without fries, so we ordered a side of that as well (since the burgers here are served with salted wafers, what a shame!) While waiting, a glance at their specials board mentioned chicken biryani. That struck us as odd, given that this place is known for its americanized cuisine. After a short wait, the burgers arrived.

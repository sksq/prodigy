Quite near to the place where I reside. I actually have this great love for desserts which makes me run for them. We went here after finishing our dinner. Interior decoration was good. Seating arrangement is average. Coming to the desserts, these guys serve best desserts we ordered bannoffee pie and an other dessert which tasted quite good. You should give them a try.", "timestamp": "2016-07-15 20:55:32", "source": "zomato", "review_and_follow": ["110", "675"], "rating": "Rated 5.0", "likes": "0"}, {"comments": "0", "text": "Despite the good reviews, I felt the food and the ambience a bit of let down for the prices they charge.

Had been waiting to go since a long time and finally I did. To begin with, the interiors are bright and there are a lot of colours which is a delight. Being a huge Zomato follower, I go by what Zomato says the first time I am visiting a place. Zomato recommended the Hazelnut Cr\u00e8me Pot and I knew that's what I wanted to have. I cannot even start explaining how mind blowing it was ! It was so so so good ! Oh my God, starting from the cream on top, moving down to the chocolate within to combining them altogether with the crumbly base. I have never had such a well balanced and amazing dessert which didn't have ice cream in it ! Just wow ! And it looks spectacular to be honest. It looks like a dish from a Michelin starred Chef. So sophisticated and elegant. God ! Anyway, I even had a Baked Cheesecake with Cranberry and Plum Sauce which was good. It was something different in taste and that's something I love. Even that looked amazing though. So all in all, based on these two desserts, I highly recommend going there and trying out the Hazelnut Cr\u00e8me Pot of all things, first. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 is because the music inside was a little too loud and according to me the Pot is a little overpriced for its size. If they increase the size of that, there is nothing that's gonna stop customers from going there ! So go and get Berry'd Alive people !", "timestamp": "2016-07-14 20:14:10", "source": "zomato", "review_and_follow": ["78", "88"], "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "0"}, {"comments": "0", "text": "This place is pretty famous but I did not have such a nice experience. \nOnly their chocolate based desserts were perfect in taste. \nThe raspberry peach Pavlova was a huge let down and we actually had to send it back because it smelled of stale fruits, the lychee pavlova that they sent as a replacement was okay but not so good. \nThe service and seating were great but I did not have such a great time.", "timestamp": "2016-07-14 00:30:00", "source": "zomato", "review_and_follow": ["18", "44"], "rating": "Rated 3.0", "likes": "0"}, {"comments": "0", "text": "We had the Hazelnut Creme Pot and Blueberry Vannila and Almond Crumble Sundae.

They don't take any reservations.\n\nEXPERIENCE & AMBIENCE\n - 3/5 - The chairs and the place seems minimalistic to put it kindly. Honestly they could improve their seating arrangements. The lighting is fine, and the service is at par with any other Bangalore restaurant. I guess they were going for fun and colourful, but sort of stopped midway in the interior construction.\n\nDESSERTS \u00a0- 4.5/5 - They serve really good straberry and peach parfaits, except you should check if they have strawberry's available. They have really good double decker brownies. The caramel cheesecake is pretty could, though I get a feeling that the portions are getting smaller day by day.\n\nEXPENSE - 2.5/5 - A couple of years back the place seemed way more worth it. Now the prices are not changing though the portions have become smaller. I'd go here if you were okay paying around Rs 150-200 per item.

Berry\u2019d Alive is a gift from a chosen few individuals for people with an entire sweet jaw like us.\n\nWe have visited the Koramangala, Indiranagar and Phoenix mall branches. The ambience is kept bright and cheery, in tune with the happiness desserts intend to impart. Since the services are prepaid, you need to first choose your dessert, pay up front (using a cool tiny card swipe machine!) and then settle down; the dessert\u00a0 comes to you all decked up.\n\nRight, presentation is important for desserts which is why a special mention for the Berry\u2019d Alive staff is deserved. We have come across excited youngsters clicking away in delight at the desserts every time we have walked in to any Berry\u2019d Alive branch.\u00a0 At the same time, they do take care that the dessert actually tastes just as yummy as it looks. Totaling all our visits, there would only be a few items we wouldn\u2019t have sampled. Among the ones we have had, Lychee Pavlova, Caramel Chocolate tart, Peanut Butter Crumble Pudding and Dark Chocolate Delice are our favorites.\n\nSingle, double or multiple: come in any numbers. Berry\u2019d Alive will make your day.", "timestamp": "2016-06-23 12:15:33", "source": "zomato", "review_and_follow": ["20", "59"], "rating": "Rated 4.5", "likes": "1"}, {"comments": "0", "text": "The only reason I tried this place is for the hazelnut creme pot which was recommend by one of my friends.

The ambience is casual. They have an open kitchen. On the other side of the wall there are reviews written on the sticky papers. They have a great menu. There's puddings, tarts, pies, cheesecakes and sundaes.\n\nI've tried Brownie and Bomb, Double Decker Brownie and Blueberry Choco Chip Cheesecake. The Brownie and Bomb was delicious. It's a Brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and dressed with chocolate sauce. It was enticing and chocolatey. It had just enough ice cream to cool it down. Double Decker Brownie was a let down. The Brownie was good. The caramel mousse was sour. It was topped chocolate sauce. The mousse and the sauce dint go together. There wasn't anything soothing in the dish. It was a disappointing dish. Blueberry cheesecake would be my pick. Though the Oreo crust was hard as rock, the cheese was moist and sugary. The cake was topped with blueberries. The blueberry was sweet and sour, and goes well with the cheese.\n\nThe service is good. The quality is good. It may not be the freshest but it's well maintained. The pricing is decent.

We spinned the app to locate this place. It was already 11:30 but we were lucky to find it open. We were informed that it will only be take away since the service has closed.\n\nWe ordered for Baked Cheesecake with cranberry & Plum Sauce, Hazelnut Creme Pot & Dark Chocolate Delice. The order was served in less that 10 mins. We requested that we sit and finish the dessert by the time they close out. They happily agreed.\n\nThe portion sizes were smaller than expected at the price point it was offered. The cheese cake was too dry (not among the best ones I have had). The hazelnut creme pot was an interesting creation which had a crubmling hazelnut & cookie pot. The dark chocolate was my personal favourite because of the richness in the chocolate.\n\nHowever, the portion sizes were too small which might not make dessert lover regular at this place.

It is running it's brand name since a decade, and obviously since, it's very much packed. Although, after you get through the crowd, the food is promising. After much waiting, soothe your guts with their 'Ferrero Rocher' shake. American cheese burger is a must try, although one must explore the menu. My suggestion is to go there in a big group, so that you get to order lot many different things and get a taste of all. The quantity that they serve is also quite a bit, and i wouldn't rate it as an overpriced place. \nPros: Food, food and food\nCons: Crowd, crowd and crowd\n\nHappy Munching :)", "timestamp": "2016-07-13 22:20:04"}, {"review_and_follow": ["3", "6"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "text": "As usual mentained the truffles standards went n no of times n liked every tym dis outlet is a bit lacky in terms of service mayo used is a bit different in taste rest all cool...", "timestamp": "2016-07-13 21:25:19"}, {"review_and_follow": ["3", "1"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "text": "After a long wait, finally went to try this restaurant.

But I actually can't say less about this one.So here it goes:\n\nI have been here at least 6 times, of which got a straight NO to my face the first time for showing up here by 930 pm on a Saturday night. It was so darn crowded that the lady said the restaurant is closed because too many people are waiting already. That made me want to visit this restaurant again, so went there the very next day.\n\nI had reached there by 1230 pm , thought nobody would show up since the restaurant opens only by 12. But guess what?, I got the table only by 1400. I was so pissed when I had gone in.\n\nBut here's the thing, once I was in I couldn't even remember the duration of time I had waited outside.\n\nFood which I have ordered till now is either very good or great.\n\nThings you should probably order:\nCheese burger\nButter paneer Burger (Yummy desi flavour)\nVery vanilla (it has just a bit of caramel taste but it's P-E-R-F-E-C-T)\nFerero rocher milk shake\nFiery baby corn\n\nI have heard there are lots of items on the menu which is not even up to the mark, but why bother about that when there is options for tasty one's.\n\nI don't eat chicken, yet based on what I heard you can try\n\nTex Mex burger\nPeri Peri Burger\nSloppy Joe\n\nI like the blueberry cheesecake here, there's not a good amount of cheese though, yet it tastes good.\n\nTheir wafers and the mayo, the combination is just too good. I personally am a huge fan of their Mayo.\n\nAbout their service, have to tell it's one of the best you can get in such a busy restaurant.\nNormally if there's too much crowd waiting, the waiter will take your order really quick and bring the items ASAP so that you leave and they can make more business from the same table. But these people have broken the rules.\n\nOnce you have placed your main course(let's say), these people will not even be nearing your table unless you call them. You get your time and space to eat.\n\nThey will show up at least two minutes post your plates becoming empty, which is superb, and that explains for me waiting outside for the sake of a table.\n\nAmbience is good, definitely not the silent type of a restaurant, you can bring your gang, office mates, or a huge group of people less than ten I guess and spend good amount of time doing chit chat along with tasty food.\n\nPrice is very nominal, in fact cheap for the standard of food provided, be it in quality or quantity.\n\nYou can order and eat through Swiggy too, the taste still doesn't get spoiled .\n\nTill now, of all the times I have been here only twice I got a table before half an hour, rest at least 90 minutes.\n\nSo either don't give up, or show up by 1155 sharp so that you can get a table without waiting.\n\nFOOD - 4/5\nAMBIENCE - 4/5\nSERVICE - 4.5/5\nPRICE -4/5", "timestamp": "2016-06-30 03:47:06"}, {"review_and_follow": ["2", "2"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "0", "rating": "Rated 5.0", "text": "I always eat at this place whenever I go to Koramangala.

It was a Saturday evening so there was a lot of rush and we had to wait around 50 mins. The place is nice and the food was awesome. The items I ordered included All American cheese burger (regular) with ham and frozen hazelnut cold coffee. The burger was really huge and out of the world, the coffee was fine. Also tried blueberry cheesecake which was fine (not really a fan of cheesecakes).

What do I say about this place? This is THE place which treats mood-swings of all sorts!\n\nA decent caf\u00e9 place in the heart of Koramangala, this place has everything required to soothe all the senses.\n\nStarting with the finger food- fries are decent here. The quantity is ample and not too oily as well. Nachos are an all-time favorite here. The sauce is perfectly made and it is quite filling.\n\nFried mozzarella were a high expectation but the fried cheese rolls dint touch the senses well.\n\nComing to burgers, All American cheese burger is the basic one (at the best). The cheese is at the right quantity and the mayo kept at the table makes up for the extra-specific cheese lovers.\n\nWedge-Mex burger is for the nachos-wedges lovers. It is my personal favorite and it is way too filling even for a regular sized burger.\n\nI did not like the Crunchy veg burger. I found it too oily and gross. It is more like gobi Manchurian with cabbage filled with cheese. But if you are a fried food fan this burger is for you.\n\nRussian Salad submarine was an average. This is more for people who are on a salad diet and crave for something cheesy- a sheer non-foodie fan.\n\nMac and cheese is another yum part of the menu where the boiled macaroni has ample amount of cheese on it. Though it is bland, it is a quick food.\n\nPastas are really worth the money. I felt that the red sauced pastas are much better than the white sauced ones. I\u2019ve ordered Pasta Arabbiata thrice here and it seems to taste better each time than the previous time.\n\nComing to desserts this place is heaven! Red velvet cake and Kahlua fantasy are my all-time favorites.\n\nAll the desserts have their specific distinct taste- be it the gooey DBC or the surprise hazelnut at the bottom of the Bulls Eye or the seedy taste in the Blueberry cheese cake or the soft Tiramisu which leaves a lingering coffee taste behind and many others.\n\nI just felt that the cup cakes were slightly over-priced. \n\nThe sundaes are fantabulous too. This, literally at the end of eating this is what you get called \u201cfoodgasm\u201d. Have the red velvet sludge or choco hotch potch and you\u2019ll understand what I meant.\n\nOverall, I have had a fantastic experience every time I\u2019m here.

Their American Cheese burger will melt in your mouth and there is no way you won't like it.

After passing by several times and getting discouraged by the number of people waiting outside, we decided to brave it out on a Friday night. The hostess gives everyone a standard wait time of 20-30 mins and surprisingly they do mean it. \nIt took us 30 mins to get a table in the outdoor seating area. The night was pleasant and the ambience was cozy. We requested the server to tone down the volume of the music and our request was promptly granted. \nWe ordered for strawberry granita and frappe and fried mozzarella sticks to begin with, followed by crunchy veg burger and the all American XL burger. The drinks are pretty standard but the rest was sublime. The burger urges you to use both hands and keep a tissue handy to wipe off the sauce dripping down your face. The crunchy veg burger was something I haven't seen before. It's like schezwan crispy fried veggies in a bun with a tangy sauce. \nThis isn't a dainty knife and fork restaurant.

Both the outlets are pretty much same. There are 2 outlets in St Marks road. The smaller one is to manage the crowd. The ambience is vibrant, social, musical.... This place is always crowded and they don't take reservations! Also they don't serve pork and beef! They have a wide menu salad, sides, burgers, pasta, sandwich, steak, seafood, sundaes, different types of coffee, cakes, sodas, frappe...                                                                       I've tried the chicken lasagne, All American Cheese Burger, Hot Dogs, Ferrero Rocher Cake Fudge and Marshmallow and Cookie Sludge.                            The chicken lasagne was good. Well cooked pasta and well seasoned chicken. It was cheesy, most importantly fresh and hot. \nThe All American Cheese Burger is a thick chicken patty with lettuce, tomato and cheese. The burger is served with potato chips. Also there's mayonnaise in every table. Although it isn't the great. The burger is rich and heavenly. \nMy friend Sarthak Baijal  tried Wedge Mex Burger. This is unique. It's has a patty of potato wedges, nachos, cheese and jalape\u00f1os. This is an ultimate Mexican Burger, great idea, great flavour.\nThere hot dog is big, juicy and creamy. Well aged chicken sausage served with lettuce, mustard and mayo.\n\nHere the desserts are Divine. The Ferror Roacher Cake Fudge is tantalizing. It is layers of cakey brownies, vanilla ice cream and Ferror Roachers topped with a Ferror Roacher and whipped cream. It's chocolatey and the most enticing in it is the Nutella in Ferror Roacher.

I had to wait for around 45 mins (which indeed led me to a business plan: What if I do multiple \u00a0bookings and sell my seats to someone, \"I hope readers are \u00a0not taking this seriously \" :P ), but they have this cool app which gives you the live status of the queue so you can hangout around kormangala \u00a0without actually waiting outside the store.", "timestamp": "2016-04-10 12:06:31"}, {"review_and_follow": ["6", "6"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "text": "Awesome food.

A bit too long, but the waiting updates was impressive. \nComing to the food - our order was Butter Garlic prawns, passion fruit mojito, all American cheese burger lamb and spaghetti carbonara.\nPassion fruit mojito - well brewed. 4/5\nButter Garlic prawns - Very well made. Subtle flavours. Only the tails on the prawns were a bit of disappoint for me. But it's a must have. 4.5/5\nSpaghetti carbonara - very well prepared. Tasty. Served perfectly hot. But it's more spaghetti in cheese sauce and less carbonara. It has way too much sauce for being a carbonara. 3.5/5\nAll American Lamb Cheese Burger - Very well made. Lamb patty very well grilled. And the sauces were very good. Yes the cheese patty should have been a bit more gooey, rest very well made. 3.5/5\n\nBut yes the hype is over the top. Not as worth.

The Peri Peri Chicken was wonders as were the other two dishes. We also ordered the All American Cheese Burger in veg and Chicken.

Taste: Awesome food. American burger and ferrero rocher drink is awesome. Peri peri chicken is also a must try. (4.5 Stars)2.)  Ambience was Good. (4 stars)\u00a03.) Service: Highly disappointed with the service. We got a table in the open area - next to a pillar. The area did not have a proper ventilation and we requested for a change as we were feeling hot.

This place is very highly rated and the crowd outside at around 7.30 in the evening would seem to justify the rating. You even have to wait for at least 1/2 an hour raising expectations. We were there to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  We ordered for 2 veg (different flavours) , 2 American chicken burgers a chicken steak in mint sauce and a roast chicken. The waitress repeated the order and I confirmed it. The veg burgers and 1 chicken burger came in record time. Then came the steak. Thereafter ---nothing. When we told them (after a reasonable wait of about 15 minutes) one waiter came and said that there was only 1 chicken burger ordered by us. Then when we insisted that we had indeed ordered for 2 chicken burgers they said that we will get one more  in 10 minutes.  Meanwhile there was no sign of the roast chicken.  When we asked again 1 waiter came after some time and said that there was no roast chicken available.   Pathetic.  Then the original waitress comes and tells us that no one told her about the non availability of the roast chicken and so we were also kept in the dark for almost three quarters of an hour. We were asked to order again in place of the roast, I ordered a steak. The lesser said about that the better.

This place is very highly rated and the crowd outside at around 7.30 in the evening would seem to justify the rating. You even have to wait for at least 1/2 an hour raising expectations. We were there to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  We ordered for 2 veg (different flavours) , 2 American chicken burgers a chicken steak in mint sauce and a roast chicken. The waitress repeated the order and I confirmed it. The veg burgers and 1 chicken burger came in record time. Then came the steak. Thereafter ---nothing. When we told them (after a reasonable wait of about 15 minutes) one waiter came and said that there was only 1 chicken burger ordered by us. Then when we insisted that we had indeed ordered for 2 chicken burgers they said that we will get one more  in 10 minutes.  Meanwhile there was no sign of the roast chicken.  When we asked again 1 waiter came after some time and said that there was no roast chicken available.   Pathetic.  Then the original waitress comes and tells us that no one told her about the non availability of the roast chicken and so we were also kept in the dark for almost three quarters of an hour. We were asked to order again in place of the roast, I ordered a steak. The lesser said about that the better.

And definitely you can't miss Mayo bottles on table which you can ask to refill n- number of times, so what else you need. \nSteaks - was very well prepared and were served sizzling hot. The thick brown sauce was so tasty and it comes with some continental herbs, rice, mashed potatoes and some saut\u00e9ed vegetable, truely amazing. \nPasta - It was served with some red and yellow zucchini tossed with garlic and celery in white mushroom sauce, since i personally like anything in form of mushroom so I liked the dish, but still I would let others as well to try this out once. \nSo before say \" pheww...i am done\" have some space left for their Blueberry Cheesecake and gooey mud cake.\n\nOne best thing to call out the \"Staff\" , they all were very nice and attend their customers wisely, infact by the time we were having our food I did noticed - their was a couple with their daughter, and the Staff took care of her very cautiously when she was playing around. \n\nSo overall its a nice place where you will be served with tasty burgers, steaks and lot more with affordable pricing.

Had to wait for about an hour to get a seat, although (being a Pune resident) the wait wasn't a great bother. They also have the inresto tracking service which made it easier to see where I stand in the queue of visitors, so that I don't have to bother the attendant about how long I'll have to wait. \nThe atmosphere and the music was lively, with a young crowd. Service was quick and efficient. \nI ordered the famous All American cheese burger along with an Oreo shake. Owing to my hunger which was slightly aggrevated after the hour long wait, I decided to order the extra large variant of the said burger. \nThe burger was big with succulent chicken and the barbeque sauce added to the taste. But the cheese burst patty (you heard it right) stole the show and how! Never had I eaten a burger which couldn't do with some extra cheese. This burger has well and truly changed that perception. If you have problems with excessive cheese, I'd suggest you go for the regular alternative or another burger altogether, as even I was taken off guard by the sheer quantity of it. The flavour of the burger was exciting and the cheese slows you down by the end which makes having a drink accompaniment necessary to refresh your palete. \nEnter Oreo cold coffee. I remember, wondering what would happen if one mixed coffee, Oreo, ice cream, whipped cream and topped it off with chocolate sauce. Well I did find its result. It tastes just as good as it sounds, maybe slightly better. \nBy the end of it all, I was filled, content and thinking of an excuse to come back to Banglore and thus here. \n\nAmbience: 4.5\nFood: 4.5\nService: 5\nOverall: 4.5\n\nA must visit joint!", "timestamp": "2016-01-15 19:49:17"}, {"review_and_follow": ["17", "2"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "text": "Easily one of the most busiest restaurants in the city.

And definitely you can't miss Mayo bottles on table which you can ask to refill n- number of times, so what else you need. \nSteaks - was very well prepared and were served sizzling hot. The thick brown sauce was so tasty and it comes with some continental herbs, rice, mashed potatoes and some saut\u00e9ed vegetable, truely amazing. \nPasta - It was served with some red and yellow zucchini tossed with garlic and celery in white mushroom sauce, since i personally like anything in form of mushroom so I liked the dish, but still I would let others as well to try this out once. \nSo before say \" pheww...i am done\" have some space left for their Blueberry Cheesecake and gooey mud cake.\n\nOne best thing to call out the \"Staff\" , they all were very nice and attend their customers wisely, infact by the time we were having our food I did noticed - their was a couple with their daughter, and the Staff took care of her very cautiously when she was playing around. \n\nSo overall its a nice place where you will be served with tasty burgers, steaks and lot more with affordable pricing. It's a must visit place for anyone who is in Bangalore or planning to visit.\n\nHappy Eating!!", "timestamp": "2016-01-16 13:33:56"}, {"review_and_follow": ["2", "19"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "text": "So I visited this place on a busy friday afternoon. Had to wait for about an hour to get a seat, although (being a Pune resident) the wait wasn't a great bother. They also have the inresto tracking service which made it easier to see where I stand in the queue of visitors, so that I don't have to bother the attendant about how long I'll have to wait. \nThe atmosphere and the music was lively, with a young crowd. Service was quick and efficient. \nI ordered the famous All American cheese burger along with an Oreo shake. Owing to my hunger which was slightly aggrevated after the hour long wait, I decided to order the extra large variant of the said burger. \nThe burger was big with succulent chicken and the barbeque sauce added to the taste. But the cheese burst patty (you heard it right) stole the show and how! Never had I eaten a burger which couldn't do with some extra cheese. This burger has well and truly changed that perception. If you have problems with excessive cheese, I'd suggest you go for the regular alternative or another burger altogether, as even I was taken off guard by the sheer quantity of it. The flavour of the burger was exciting and the cheese slows you down by the end which makes having a drink accompaniment necessary to refresh your palete. \nEnter Oreo cold coffee. I remember, wondering what would happen if one mixed coffee, Oreo, ice cream, whipped cream and topped it off with chocolate sauce. Well I did find its result. It tastes just as good as it sounds, maybe slightly better. \nBy the end of it all, I was filled, content and thinking of an excuse to come back to Banglore and thus here. \n\nAmbience: 4.5\nFood: 4.5\nService: 5\nOverall: 4.5\n\nA must visit joint!", "timestamp": "2016-01-15 19:49:17"}, {"review_and_follow": ["1", "41"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "1", "rating": "Rated 4.5", "text": "My favourite place to eat in Bangalore! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4dspecially - all American cheese burger and Irish coffee.

Their burgers come in various sizes which is a good variations. Mains are a hearty portion for a medium to a heavy eater. The loaded nachos are a must try as well as any of their fancy milk shakes.

And rightly so, it has all the ingredients to make itself more than just 'A place for a good meal' to a place for 'An experience'. \n\nFirst up, you get ready, you grab your friends and then reach here. If it's the first time, you would see A LOT of people (mostly youngsters) already waiting at the waiting area and also sparsely spread in the parking space and that street. That's when the first realisation strikes that you might have to wait for an hour or two. But I must say the allocation of tables is so well organised that probably an hour will be the maximum waiting time. The street outside is calm and you can have a good chat with your friends in the meanwhile. There is also a place in the corner of the street which sells Badam milk. Do check it out! Once your table is ready, you get a text message. Just make sure you are close by and get the table. \n\nIt's a very small place and so don't expect much space on the inside. Tables are pretty closely packed with just about enough spacing to be saved for privacy. \n\nThe waiters are friendly and the service is prompt. Dedicated service is usually better but here there is good coordination between the waiters that following up on orders doesn't become an issue. \n\nFood is no less than amazing! I have visited this place thrice and tried a variety of their burgers (Burgers are the thing here) with 'All American Chicken Cheese' being the best pick.

I had better lamb burgers elsewhere (India and abroad). I wish they had put some cheese or Mayo in the burger by default. Having ordered a XL version (really big), the edges of the burger tasted better than the middle!

After an endless wait outside lasting nearly an hour, along with my family (kids included), it was finally time to live the legend that gets cooked here. We went for the safe classics - Lamb burgers, BBQ chicken, Chicken Burgers and Pastries. I think the burgers were good but definitely not in the league of \"Legendary\". I had better lamb burgers elsewhere (India and abroad). I wish they had put some cheese or Mayo in the burger by default. Having ordered a XL version (really big), the edges of the burger tasted better than the middle! What was missing was the comfort of liquid-y cheese or mayo goodness - it almost felt I was left alone with\u00a0 just a piece of lamb steak and so-so bun once my bites reached the middle. :-)\n\nThe BBQ chicken was great -\u00a0 And yes, I really mean it. I had some pretty stingy over-fried wings even in US (Buffalo Wild Wings and other local joints), but the ones I got in Truffles in my\u00a0own namma Bangalore, beat the US-version by miles. Good job here.\n\nThe Pastries were mostly consumed by my family and from the smiles and expression of their faces, I knew it had to be good. \n\nI really wish they do something to reduce the agony of waiting outside the restaurant.", "timestamp": "2015-11-10 18:33:31"}, {"review_and_follow": ["32", "55"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "0", "rating": "Rated 4.0", "text": "Must go there for American food.

Also, the menu is nicely designed provided with the many quantity options. The staff is great here, but I just don't understand the idea of giving one menu between four or five people.\u00a0\n\nDefinitely coming back :)\nHighly Recommended !", "timestamp": "2015-10-25 01:15:03"}, {"review_and_follow": ["53", "121"], "comments": "0", "source": "zomato", "likes": "3", "rating": "Rated 3.5", "text": "I found this place a little over hyped.

And when I say this place I mean, any of their branches. Food delicious, service quality impeccable and ambience always pleasant. And although I've had several dishes here, there's only one dish that I remember how it exactly tastes like coz I haven't had that good anywhere else. The cottage cheese burger. Top it with the Mayonnaise sauce they serve along (another reason I'll always remember this place) it tastes heavenly. Last but not the least, this is the only place that has offered me a burger that I wasn't able to finish. Their portions are huge!!
